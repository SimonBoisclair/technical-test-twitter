##This is a project to demonstrate my abilities to develop using REACT.JS, REDUX, REDUX-SAGAS and WEBPACK.  

###The description of the task was:

1) Create a simple view that will get all the latest tweets about Donald Trump.
2) Create a simple view that will get all the latest tweets about Hilary Clinton.
3) Add a button that will update the state of the app to switch the view from one to the other.
